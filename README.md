# ONLINE ADVERTISEMENT CLICK-THROUGH RATES

# Project Overview and Objective

This project focuses on analyzing user engagement with online advertisements using demographic data, ad-related attributes, click behavior, click time, and click-through rates (CTR).

The main objective of this project is to analyze the factors that impact advertisement click-through performance and provide insights to optimize online ad strategies.

# Data Sources 

Source Description and Timeline: Mendeley Data and 2024.

Domain: Digital Marketing Analytics/Online Advertising/User Behavior.



# Tools & Technologies

Excel: Data cleaning, transformation, and Pivot Tables.

Power BI: Data modelling, DAX calculations, visualization, and interactive dashboard creation.

# Data Pre-Processing (Excel / Power Query)

Tasks Performed:

Data Cleaning & Transformation: 

The Click Time column carries same value in every row; it doesn’t provide any useful information for analysis. 

Dropped the Income column, as it contains values for some age groups, so it doesn’t provide a complete view. Removing it avoids confusion and simplifies analysis.

Standardized formats and created a calculated column Impression.

Filtering & Sorting: Organized data to focus on relevant records.

Pivot Tables: Generated Pivot Tables for data summarization and initial insights.

# Data Modelling and DAX (Power BI) 

Data Model: This project uses a single-table dataset, so data model remains simple with no relationships. All measures and visuals are built from the same table.

Calculated Columns & DAX Measures: Implemented DAX formulas for key metrics such as Total clicks, Total Impressions, Average CTR, Total conversion rate.


 # Insights & Conclusions

Key Findings: 

Total Impressions: 1.18M

Total Clicks: 49K

Average CTR: 5.10%

Male users (49.84%) generate the highest share of clicks

Highest clicks from 30–45 age group (191 clicks)

Very low engagement from Above 65 (9 clicks)


# Conclusions 

   The online advertisement campaign performed well with a 5.10% average CTR, showing that users aged 30–45 are the most responsive, males click slightly more than females, social media and search engine placements generate the highest engagement, finance and technology topics perform best, and ads are least effective for users below 15 and above 65.
      
  Overall analysis suggests that future ad campaigns will achieve higher click-through rates if they focus on users aged 15–45, prioritize social media and search engine placements, and promote high-interest topics such as finance, technology, and travel, while reducing spend on low-engagement age groups like below 15 and above 65.
